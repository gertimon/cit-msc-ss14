The developed system considered as a whole is capable to let a user configure fast or slow access to his stored files through a \textit{fast} and a \textit{economic} profile. The file system is distributed over a powerful server and a standard office computer. This is where file system operations take place fast and energy-rich or slower with less energy consumption. In collaboration with the SDN the distributed file system knows the profiles and directs the user's file access to the right machine. SDN takes care to detect new connection establishments and disconnections, pushing traffic data to the monitoring and the routing. A user has the possibility to choose how to access its stored files, whether one needs fast access or just do not want to waste energy and at the same time save money. Any information which the developed system needs to operate and even more is monitored by Zabbix. Through this data reports and bills are generated to have a detailed overview about data access and used energy. This is a new idea on how to host files for users and could be applied to cloud services. Furthermore it could be generated new tariff models in \textit{Green-IT} to bill customers not by memory usage or by traffic but by energy consumption.
