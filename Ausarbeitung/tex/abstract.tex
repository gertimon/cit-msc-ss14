Motivated by reducing power consumption of a huge data store the Apache Hadoop\textsuperscript{\textregistered} filesystem was analyzed and modified as described in this paper. 

A software defined network based on Floodlight and Open vSwitch was used to collect network flow data which were stored together with current system drain in a monitoring system called zabbix.

To optimize the power usage different data delivery strategies were implemented and tested for the hadoop system.
