In these days, people use distributed file systems privately and at work for nearly everything. This means that features like bandwidth, Quality of Service and reliability of these systems are very important. Moreover in the last years the ecological aspect of saving energy got very important, too. This paper introduces a distributed file system which combines all the important aspects by using Apache Hadoop which is controlled by a Software Defined Network and monitored and evaluated by the Zabbix monitoring system. Moreover it let decide a file system user whether to save energy and access files with less speed or to go with the usual energy consumption and access files with high speed. Besides, chapter~\ref{sec:outlook} gives ideas for adding intelligence and adaptiveness to an algorithm which knows best when to save energy.
