%Motivated by reducing power consumption of a huge data store the Apache Hadoop\textsuperscript{\textregistered} filesystem was analyzed and modified as described in this paper. 

%A software defined network based on Floodlight and Open vSwitch was used to collect network flow data which were stored together with current system drain in a monitoring system called zabbix.

%To optimize the power usage different data delivery strategies were implemented and tested for the hadoop system.


In these days, people use distributed file systems privately and at work for nearly everything. This means that features like bandwidth, Quality of Service and reliability of these systems are very important for us. Moreover in the last years the ecological aspect of saving energy got very important, too. This paper introduces a distributed file system which combines all the important aspects by using Apache Hadoop\textsuperscript{\textregistered} which is controlled by a Software Defined Network and monitored and evaluated by the Zabbix monitoring system.
